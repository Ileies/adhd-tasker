# ADHD Tasker
This project is a simple task management application designed to help individuals with ADHD manage their tasks and stay focused. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks for specific times during the day, set reminders, and categorize tasks based on priority.

## It works like the following:
1. Users can create tasks with a title, description, and time.
2. Tasks can be categorized by priority (high, medium, low).
3. Then, the currently active task is displayed on full screen.
4. The background changes color based on the time left to complete it.
5. When a task with higher priority starts, it replaces the currently active task.
6. When the task is clicked, it gets completed and the next task is displayed.
7. A short sound plays when the task is started, completed, or changes.
8. From time to time, a short sound plays to remind the user to stay focused.
